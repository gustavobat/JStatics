**JStatics** uses Matrix Analysis to solve 2D frames from a JSON file.

JStatics was developed as a research project during my graduation in Civil Engineering and, 
although the project is now completed, I intend to add new functions to it in my spare time.

The project contains two applications, a **CLI** one and a **GUI** one. 
It uses the following external libraries:    
    ● [NeoPZ](https://github.com/labmec/neopz)    
    ● [PThreads](https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/)    
    ● [Qt 5.9.1](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.9/5.9.1/)
